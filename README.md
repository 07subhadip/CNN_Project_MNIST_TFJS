## 💡 About The Project
This isn't just another digit recognizer. This project demonstrates the power of **Edge AI**. 
Instead of sending your drawing to a Python server (which is slow and costly), we converted a **96% accurate CNN model** into **TensorFlow.js**.

**Why is this cool?**
- ⚡ **Zero Latency:** Inference happens locally on your device (Client-side).
- 🔒 **Privacy First:** Your drawing data never leaves your browser.
- 🎨 **Interactive UI:** Custom HTML5 Canvas "Blackboard" experience.
- 📉 **Serverless:** Hosted 100% on GitHub Pages without any backend.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally
If you want to test this on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/07subhadip/CNN_Project_MNIST_TFJS.git
   ```

2. **Run a local server:** Because of CORS security policies, you cannot simply double-click index.html. You need a local server.

   * **VS Code:** Install "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live".
   * **Python:** Run `python -m http.server` in the folder.
